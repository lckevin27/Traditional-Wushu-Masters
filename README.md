This site was built under the background when video parodies about a so-called Tai-chi master Ma Baoguo were trending all over the Internet in China. The parodies were massively based on a video that the Wushu master was knocked out 3 times by an amateur boxer in a few minutes. Video can be seen here: [Tai Chi Master Ma Baoguo got KOed in less than 30 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94aQsvctFoI&has_verified=1&ab_channel=purportedland).

This event exposed the true level of Ma Baoguo, but there are still many more fake masters exaggerating about how they can beat all the modern martial artists easily with their skills. They even cooperated with many Chinese mainstream TV channels to show their fake skills by beating up MMA fighters (which were actually not and they were asked to act like they were beaten badly). They used these tricks to increase their popularities, and hence recruit students and charge high tuition fees.

The website collects news, pictures and videos of some of the most popular Tradition Wushu masters in China, revealed some of their scams. Hope more people will be aware of these despicable stories of them.

此站建于马保国的热度巅峰之时，当时各大媒体网站及论坛上都流传着各种马保国的鬼畜、恶搞视频。一个人的滑稽给人们带来快乐本来是一件很好的事情，但是渐渐地，在此次事件「搞笑」的影响下，越来越多的人忘了马保国本质上是一个利用传统武术行骗的骗徒，开始觉得马保国并没有那么「坏」，反倒是一个「和蔼可亲」的老人家。

于是便有了本站 - [传武大师](chuanwudashi.com)。本站收集了几位知名的传统武术大师的资料，以及网上能找到的一些视频和图片，将它们的一些经历整理成了时间线。让大家领略一下马保国以及他的同行们生命中的一些辉煌时刻，以顺便提醒一下大家，马保国（们）的下场并不值得一丝丝的同情。
